# Assignment #1 - Data Exploration

To wrap up our section on data processing, we'll put all of our tools to use.  The goal of this assignment is to walk through the entire data science workflow, from gathering raw data, through formulating hypotheses about the data, gaining insights, visualizing, iterating, up to presenting about your findings.

1. Gather a dataset.  You can
use one of [our datasets](../data/),
download a public dataset,
track tweets,
use [import.io](http://import.io) or
try your hand at webscraping.

1. Pose a few questions (say 1 to 3) you hope to answer from the data you've gathered

1. Process the data into a format accessible in Python and Pandas

1. Generate some descriptive statistics that aim to answer your question(s)

1. Generate 1-3 plots that attempt to answer the questions you've posed.  Make the plots stand on their own, without explanation.  This means properly label the axis, include titles and legends.

1. Prepare a short presentation (2-3 minutes) in which you present your findings.  You can create your presentation with Apple KeyNote, MS PowerPoint, Google Slides, or any other program of your choosing. It's fine to present straight from your ipython notebook, but keep in mind that that's not always the most clear medium - especially when presenting to a lay audience like your non-data science colleagues.


#### Guidelines
- Due **Sunday 7/12** at night (Antoine will tell you how)
    + Submit code and results
    + Do not submit original dataset if it's fairly large (>2M), but please provide a link to the source of your data
- **Tuesday 7/14** presentations in class
    + a few plots, a few minutes, clear conclusions
- mandatory for graduation


#### Example

The presentation [Complaining About New York](./assignment_01_example.pdf)  gives some statistics about New York's 311 complaints, based on a dataset from [NYC Open Data](http://nycopendata.socrata.com). This presentation already more than is required: any notenook with similar plots would suffice.
